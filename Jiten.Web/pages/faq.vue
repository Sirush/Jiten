  What can I use your decks for?
  Feel free to use them for anything you want, but I'll respectfully ask you to not scrape them to start a competing website. If you redistribute the decks, I'd appreciate a linkback to the website! :)

  Why is X missing?
  While I aim to make the website the most complete it can be, it's an arduous process and I have to prioritize some medias over others. If you have a specific request, please let me know on Discord, and it'll be added depending on the availability to source the text.

How accurate are the media decks?
  For VNs: Extracting the text from VNs is a manual process. They should be fairly accurate but might contain extra text depending on the engine. Please report anything that seems off.
  For books: The books are extracted in a semi-automated way, and may still contain extra infos like the table of content, please be aware of it.
For anime/movies/dramas: The decks are based on subtitle files, extracted in a semi-automated way. The subtitles themselves might have mistakes. There's also a chance the episode count, the episode numbers, etc, are not accurate. If you find any mistakes, please let me know on Discord.

  Why is the word count or character count different from another website?
  The text extraction process is custom-made and can be different for each website. The character count should be mostly the same, unless there's data that's missing or data that was erroneously included. For example, a game can contain item text in another file that was forgotten to be included. The word count can have more differences as there's different ways the words can be split, for example with the conjugation. If you find anything that looks erroneous, please let me know on Discord.

  Which websites do you source the informations from?
  [Insert logos]
  VNDB, TMDB, Anilist, Jimaku

  What's next for the website?
  For a more accurate roadmap, please check out the Discord. But in general, the next steps are, in no particular order:
  - Add more decks, always
  - A user system
  - Add a complete SRS system integrated to the website
  - Support for names and custom names
  - Add a way for users to add their own, custom decks
  - Add a way for users to submit medias (which also means a moderation queue for them)

  Will you support more media types in the future?
  Yes, I plan to support webnovels, youtube, manga and video games. Those all have their own set challenges, that's why they will take more time. If you have any other suggestions, please let me know on Discord.

  Will the website ever be paid?
  The core features, which mean access to the decks, and the future SRS, will always be free. There might be some premium, extra features in the future, reserved to supporters, but I want the most important features to be accessible to all.

  Can I use your API endpoints?
  You can use them as they're publicly available, but be aware that they can change at a moment's notice without warning. They can also be rate limited to avoid overloading the servers.
